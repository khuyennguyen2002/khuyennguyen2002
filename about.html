				<p> Asides from being a coffee addict, I enjoy doing creative works such as art and writing. Currently, I'm a student at Yerba Buena and is an upcoming sophomore. In the future, I plan to major in medical researches as well as having a minor in environmental science. Whenever I have free time, I tend to play volleyball or indulge in an evening with my mind and its state of art.</p>
				<p> I have learned over the years to focus on developing myself and follow my own passion instead of listening to society's norms. As I'm gaining my confidence, I'm now making my own story in addition to impacting other's.</p>
